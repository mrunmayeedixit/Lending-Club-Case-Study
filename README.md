# Lending Club Case Study
> We have the of the loan applicants for whom the loan was approved.
> We have to analyse the data and find the major reasons because of which the defaults occur.



## Approach
- We first go though the complete data set
- Understand the metadata 
- Do complete data cleaning process 
- Then do Univariate analysis and bivariate analysis and draw conclusions from them


## Conclusions of Univeriate analysis
- From above 'loan_status' plot we understand that there are around 14% of defaulters
- More number of loan applicants prefer to take short term loans than long term
- Maximum number of people take loan for dept_consolidation
- Only 25% loan applicants are source verified

## Conclusions of Bivariate analysis
- Loan Applicants who have taken loan for longer duration are tent to become defaulters as compared to short term loan applicants
- loan applicants with less annual income are the defaulters 
- High interest rate i.e. above 12% lead to more defaulters
- Loan applicants who have high 'dti' 1.e. above 14 percentage + Mortgage are defaulters
- we can say that 5000*5000(approx. number of defaulters * approx. mean of loan amt â€“ approx. mean of total payment for charged off) i.e. mean loss for the company will be 25000000
	maximum loss = approx. : 5000*7500 = 37500000
	minimum loss = approx. 5000*2500 = 12500000
- applicants taken loan for higher loan amount tend to be defaulters
